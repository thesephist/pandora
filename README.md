# Pandora
__A small HTML5 Quiz Application__

Pandora was originally created as a part of a Valentine's day surprise, but branched out for other uses as well over the years.

There are two kinds of question that could be asked, a "short answer" and a "multiple choice". Both kinds are contained in a single array in the main javascript and parsed in real-time as the quiz is solved.

## Features
- Wrong answer limit
- Dynamic, responsive design with beautiful CSS
- Unlimited number of questions
- Optional beautiful backgrounds scaled to fit the screen dynamically, even on resize

Yeah, that's about it. Cute gift tho.
